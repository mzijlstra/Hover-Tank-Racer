Hover Tank Racer

This is my little SDL / OpenGL project. I mainly made it as a way to get some
experience with SDL and OpenGL.

The goal of the project is to make a little top down floating tank game, with 
physics (if you shoot the recoil should move the tank), an ellaborate array of
weapons (something like scorche earth), an energy management system (something
like X-Wing and Tie figther)...  And if I ever get to it, multi-display, and 
networking - Specifically to allow multiple people to control the tank, making
one person the driver, one the gunner, and perhaps a third an engineer.

Anyway, so far all I really have is some basic stuff moving around the screen,
but who knows, perhaps I'll actually build this into a nice little game someday.
